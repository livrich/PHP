To run a PHP file press Ctrl+Alt+N

In settings, I went to:
    - Run in terminal
    - Scrolled down to Code-runner: Run in terminal
    - Checked the box next to above line
This allowed me to run the inputProgram.php without an error.
It will actually run in the terminal now. However, I'm not sure
if this will mess up other code I work on in the future. So I'm 
reminding myself what I did incase I need to undo it later.
