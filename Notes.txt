To run a PHP file press Ctrl+Alt+N

Must fully exit program before running it again.
Even if I close the terminal. Otherwise, changes
will not be recognized. (In this case, I need to
press option 4 before testing changes.)

In settings, I went to:
    - Run in terminal
    - Scrolled down to Code-runner: Run in terminal
    - Checked the box next to above line
This allowed me to run the inputProgram.php without an error.
It will actually run in the terminal now. However, I'm not sure
if this will mess up other code I work on in the future. So I'm 
reminding myself what I did incase I need to undo it later.

// echo vs print
The differences are small: echo has no return value while print 
has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo 
can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while 
print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.
