# Overview

In the last two weeks of trying to learn something new, I ran into a lot of problems. Originally, I intended to learn about networking and write a program
that would let me send messages back and forth from my two computers. However, with the time constraints I was under, learning about networking felt too
overwhelming. After several days of putting of getting started, I finally decided to change my learning goal.  Instead, I decided to learn PHP.

In recent conversations, PHP has come up many times. I didn't know anything about the language, but was curious to learn more sine it has come up so often.
For whatever reason, diving into a new language felt less intimidating than networking stuff. I felt much more motivated to learn the basics of PHP. Once I
shifted my focus, I started making progress on my learning goal.

Admittedly, I wasted a lot of time not knowing where to start with networking. Thus, I didn't have a full two weeks to learn PHP. In the time I had, I tried
achieve as much as I could.

I started by setting up my environment. For the sake of time, I opted to run PHP in the terminal instead of a web browser. This allowed me to start coding
sooner instead of continuing to mess with downloads and settings.

Next, I created the classic "Hello World!" program. Doing so also confirmed that my environment was working. After that, I learned how to get input by writing
another very small program. Not knowing much about the language or its purpose, I then spent time reading about the language. I'm a bit of a slower reader,
so, I spent quite a bit of the time I had to work on this project reading about the language and its syntax.

However, with the remaining time I had, I wrote a small shopping list program. For a while, I ran into a problem that took me hours to solve. No matter what
code I changed, when I ran the program, it wasn't updating to reflect my changes. Eventually, I realized it was because I wasn't properly ending the program
before trying to run it again. Once I realized that, progress moved much more quickly. Due to that hang up, I only implemented very basic principles. My
shopping program does not implement loops or functions, which is something I'd like to add in the future.

Ultimately though, I'm happy with what I was able to accomplish in such a short amount of time. I also ended with a working program; though, it could use
some refinement. The below video is me quickly running through my working shopping program.
